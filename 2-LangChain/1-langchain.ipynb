      "**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems designed to operate as autonomous agents, capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention. These systems integrate advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs), reasoning engines, and planning algorithms to perform complex, dynamic tasks that require adaptability and learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Characteristics of Agentic AI:\n",
      "1. **Autonomy**:  \n",
      "   Agentic AI systems act independently, making decisions based on their understanding of the environment and predefined objectives. They don’t rely on rigid, rule-based instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**:  \n",
      "   They are designed to pursue specific goals, such as solving a problem, optimizing a process, or managing a task sequence (e.g., booking a trip, writing a report, or managing a virtual business).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adaptability**:  \n",
      "   These systems can adjust their strategies in response to new information, unexpected challenges, or changing environments, often using reinforcement learning or real-time feedback loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Learning and Improvement**:  \n",
      "   Agentic AI leverages machine learning to improve over time, refining its decision-making and task execution through experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration of Capabilities**:  \n",
      "   They combine multiple AI components, such as natural language understanding (for interaction), planning (for task decomposition), and reasoning (for logical inference), to handle multifaceted tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technologies Enabling Agentic AI:\n",
      "- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Provide context-aware reasoning, language understanding, and task decomposition.  \n",
      "- **Planning and Reasoning Systems**: Help agents map out steps to achieve goals (e.g., using logic, heuristics, or Monte Carlo methods).  \n",
      "- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Enables agents to learn optimal actions through trial and error in dynamic environments.  \n",
      "- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinate multiple autonomous agents to collaborate on tasks (e.g., a team of AI managing a supply chain).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Applications and Examples:\n",
      "- **Personal Assistants**: Autonomously managing schedules, financial planning, or customer service interactions.  \n",
      "- **Business Automation**: Running virtual startups, optimizing workflows, or analyzing market trends.  \n",
      "- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing patients, recommending treatments, or managing patient care plans.  \n",
      "- **Gaming/Entertainment**: Creating NPCs (non-player characters) with dynamic, goal-driven behaviors in games or simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges and Ethical Considerations:\n",
      "- **Alignment with Human Values**: Ensuring agents prioritize safety, ethics, and user intent.  \n",
      "- **Robustness**: Avoiding failures in unpredictable environments (e.g., the \"alignment problem\" in AI).  \n",
      "- **Transparency**: Making autonomous decisions explainable and auditable.  \n",
      "- **Control**: Preventing unintended consequences from self-modifying or over-ambitious agents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Current State and Future Outlook:\n",
      "Projects like **AutoGPT**, **Google’s Agent AI**, and **Meta’s Llama Agentic Framework** are early examples of Agentic AI, though they still face limitations in reliability and generalizability. As research advances, Agentic AI could revolutionize industries by replacing or augmenting human labor in complex, dynamic roles. However, its development requires addressing technical, ethical, and regulatory hurdles to ensure safe and equitable deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, Agentic AI represents a step toward **general-purpose autonomous systems**, blending specialized AI capabilities into cohesive, self-directed problem-solving entities.\n"

      "The US-Pakistan relationship is a complex one, fraught with tension and contradictions. While Pakistan has indeed been accused of supporting terrorism and the presence of Osama bin Laden on its soil was a major blow to US-Pakistan relations, the US continues to provide funding to Pakistan for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategic Interests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Counterterrorism Cooperation:** Despite the bin Laden situation, Pakistan remains a key player in the fight against terrorism, particularly against groups operating in Afghanistan and the region. The US relies on Pakistan's cooperation in sharing intelligence, conducting counterterrorism operations, and securing its border with Afghanistan.\n",
      "* **Regional Stability:** Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state and a major power in South Asia. Its stability is crucial for regional security, and the US sees it as a potential partner in balancing the influence of regional rivals like China and India.\n",
      "* **Afghanistan:** Pakistan's role in Afghanistan is significant. The US needs Pakistan's cooperation in facilitating the withdrawal of US troops and ensuring stability in Afghanistan after the withdrawal. A destabilized Pakistan could lead to a resurgence of the Taliban and other extremist groups in Afghanistan, threatening US interests in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Historical and Political Factors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Cold War Legacy:** The US and Pakistan have a long history of cooperation dating back to the Cold War, when Pakistan was seen as a bulwark against Soviet influence in South Asia. This historical relationship continues to influence US policy towards Pakistan.\n",
      "* **Shared Interests:** Despite the tensions, the US and Pakistan share some common interests, such as combating terrorism, promoting economic development, and maintaining a balance of power in the region.\n",
      "* **Political Pragmatism:** While the US has criticized Pakistan's support for terrorism, it has also recognized that a complete rupture in relations would be detrimental to its own interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**However, it's important to acknowledge the criticisms surrounding US funding to Pakistan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Double Standards:** Critics argue that the US applies double standards by continuing to fund Pakistan despite its alleged support for terrorism, while simultaneously condemning other countries for similar actions.\n",
      "* **Corruption:** Concerns exist about the effectiveness of US aid in Pakistan due to widespread corruption and mismanagement within the Pakistani government.\n",
      "* **Shifting Priorities:** Some argue that the US should prioritize its resources elsewhere, given the complex and often contradictory nature of its relationship with Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The US continues to provide funding to Pakistan due to a complex interplay of strategic interests, historical factors, and political pragmatism. While the relationship is fraught with tension and controversy, the US sees Pakistan as a key player in the region and believes that continued engagement is necessary to advance its interests. However, the US must also address concerns about corruption, transparency, and Pakistan's alleged support for terrorism to ensure that its aid is effectively utilized and does not inadvertently contribute to the very problems it seeks to address.\n",

      "Here's a breakdown of key factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Geostrategic Importance:** Pakistan's location in South Asia makes it a crucial strategic partner for the US. It shares borders with Afghanistan and India, both countries with significant geopolitical implications. \n",
      "* **Counterterrorism Cooperation:** Despite concerns, Pakistan has cooperated with the US in counterterrorism efforts, particularly against groups like al-Qaeda and the Taliban. This cooperation is seen as important in maintaining regional stability.\n",
      "* **Historical Ties:** The US and Pakistan have a long history of military and economic cooperation dating back to the Cold War. \n",
      "* **Nuclear Non-proliferation:** Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state, and the US has an interest in ensuring responsible management of its nuclear program.\n",
      "* **Political Considerations:** US aid to Pakistan is often influenced by domestic political considerations, with some arguing for continued support while others advocate for stricter conditions or reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan was a significant setback in US-Pakistan relations. It raised serious concerns about Pakistan's commitment to counterterrorism and led to a reassessment of aid. However, the US ultimately decided to continue providing some level of support, citing the strategic and counterterrorism reasons outlined above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The future of US aid to Pakistan remains uncertain and will likely continue to be debated. It depends on Pakistan's actions, the evolving security situation in the region, and the priorities of the US government.\"\n",

While Pakistan has faced criticism for its alleged support of terrorism, the US continues to provide funding for several strategic reasons:\\n\\n    * **Geostrategic Importance:** Pakistan occupies a crucial position in South Asia, bordering Afghanistan, Iran, and India. Its strategic location makes it a valuable partner in counterterrorism efforts, particularly in the fight against groups operating in Afghanistan. \\n    * **Counterterrorism Cooperation:** Despite the challenges, Pakistan has cooperated with the US in counterterrorism operations, sharing intelligence and providing logistical support. This cooperation is seen as essential in combating the threat of groups like al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\\n    * **Stability in the Region:** The US sees a stable Pakistan as crucial for regional security. Instability in Pakistan could lead to the rise of extremist groups, further destabilizing the region and potentially impacting US interests.\\n    * **Nuclear Non-Proliferation:** Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons, making it a key player in nuclear non-proliferation efforts. The US seeks to maintain a relationship with Pakistan to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology to unstable actors.\\n    * **Economic Aid:** The US provides economic assistance to Pakistan to support its development and promote economic growth. This aid is intended to strengthen Pakistan's institutions and reduce poverty, which can contribute to stability and counterterrorism efforts.\\n\\n    **The Osama bin Laden incident:** The discovery of bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 significantly strained US-Pakistan relations. However, the US continues to engage with Pakistan, recognizing the complex geopolitical realities and the need for continued cooperation on shared security concerns.\\n    \\n    **Conclusion:**\\n    While the US has legitimate concerns about Pakistan's support for terrorism, it continues to provide funding for strategic reasons related to counterterrorism, regional stability, nuclear non-proliferation, and economic development. The relationship between the two countries remains fraught with tension, but the US views engagement with Pakistan as essential for its national security interests.\\n\\n  </answer>\\n</response>\\n```\\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\\n\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 490, 'prompt_tokens': 78, 'total_tokens': 568, 'completion_time': 0.890909091, 'prompt_time': 0.004055024, 'queue_time': 0.245222866, 'total_time': 0.894964115}, 'model_name': 'gemma2-9b-it', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_10c08bf97d', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ad01d3fb-27d8-4894-bb80-d1bf348fc57d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 78, 'output_tokens': 490, 'total_tokens': 568}\n"
